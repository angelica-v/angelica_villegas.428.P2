 GitHub Documentation 

Created by Angelica Villegas Salazar.

## Introduction
This is a project for Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality taught by Professor Andy Johnson. 

The goal was to create a VR environment that could be viewed in both Unity and in the Oculus VR headset. This environment is based off a coffee shop to be located in the new CS building. I modeled my scene based on a fall/witch theme. Somedays, you need a snack/coffee before you cast spells and make potions. When walking around the scene one is able to pick up items including but not limited too, the potions, skull, cakes, cookies, and pumpkins. Additionally, if the user touches either the coffee maker screen or the over dials an new coffee cup or a new pie (cherry/pumpkin) is spawned into the game. MakeHuman and Mixamo, an animated avatar was created. If you touch the avater she mutters a spell. Additionally, the cauldron/potion, the oven, and the cat all make noises when you approach them and all potions make a clinking noise when you grab or touch them.
